# Currently in the UI, each Assistant only has one prompt, which is why there are 3 very similar assistants defined below.

assistants:
  # This id field can be left blank for other default assistants, however an id 0 assistant must exist
  # this is for DanswerBot to use when tagged in a non-configured channel
  # Careful setting specific IDs, this won't autoincrement the next ID value for postgres

    # Default Document Sets for this assistant, specified as a list of names here.
    # If the document set by the name exists, it will be attached to the assistant
    # If the document set by the name does not exist, it will be created as an empty document set with no connectors
    # The admin can then use the UI to add new connectors to the document set
    # Example:
    # document_sets:
    #   - "HR Resources"
    #   - "Engineer Onboarding"
    #   - "Benefits"
